### Installing dependencies

Portions of the code are written in [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).  Compilers for both languages and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime must be installed on the local machine.

The project is developed on OS X, but may support other UNIX platforms.  On OS X, system-level dependencies should be installed with the [`brew`](http://brew.sh/) tool. 

```
brew install node purescript
```

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is used to structure the project, supporting development and production mode builds.  ES2015 syntax is translated to JavaScript using [Babel](http://babeljs.io/).  Code quality is monitored using [JSHint](http://jshint.com/).

Use the [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) tool, included with Node.js, to install project-level dependencies.

This project was built for elm version `0.16`. `npm` may be used to install this

```
npm install elm@0.16.0
```

Use `yarn` to install packages. If you don't have `yarn`, install it using `npm install -g yarn`.

```
yarn install
```

You will also need to increase the kernel limits on OS X. 

```
sudo bash -c 'echo "kern.maxfiles=65536" >>/etc/sysctl.conf'
sudo bash -c 'echo "kern.maxfilesperproc=65536" >>/etc/sysctl.conf'
echo "ulimit -n 65536" >>~/.bash_profile
```

This may require you to restart your computer.


### Building the project

The same `npm` tool is also used to build the project, and to simplify other project-related tasks.

To build the project, give the following command:

```
npm run build
```

If the build is successful, the project is ready to run.  In one session, start a local CORS proxy:

```
npm run start-proxy
```

In another session, start a local HTTP server:

```
npm start
```

Finally, navigate to the following address in a web browser:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
